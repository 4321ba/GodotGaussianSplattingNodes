# GodotGaussianSplattingNodes

Allows developers to use gaussian splatting objects as they would use a regular mesh + mesh instance.

This is a work in progress master thesis project.

For the previous work which this project is based on, see [this](https://github.com/4321ba/GodotGaussianSplattingGame/blob/vitavehicle/documentation/documentation.md) repo, which in turn was based on the [GodotGaussianSplatting](https://github.com/2Retr0/GodotGaussianSplatting) project.
